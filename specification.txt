This software part is responsible for
searching and replacing site meta tags on the fly.

seotags.php
--------------
Processes html. 

Works only once per page request.
Tries to search <title> tag, <meta name="description"/> tag, <meta name="keywords"/> tag.
If no such tags found, error is sent to server (title-not-found, description-not-found, keywords-not-found).

Tries to find cache replacement for current page for title, description and keywords.
If replacement is found then outputs it.

Server tags values are stored also. If data is updated from client app (not seo editor).
There are 3 different tags values - current tags from server, tags from server that were last processed from seo editor, tags from cache that were last saved via seo editor. 
If current tags from server are different from the last processed tags, error is sent to seo editor (server-title-changed, server-description-changed, server-keywords-changed).

Other errors that could be returned are:
error-loading-tags-database is sent when error occured during tags cache loading on current page.
no-data-for-page is sent when no cached data is available.
